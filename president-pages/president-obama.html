    <p class="PresBio">
        And finally, number 1, Barack Obama!
        Barack Obama is an American politician and attorney who served as the 44th President of the United States, from 2009 to 2017.
        He was born on August 4, 1961, in Honolulu, Hawaii.
        Obama attended Columbia University and Harvard Law School.
        He was elected to the Illinois State Senate in 1996 and served there until his election to the U.S. Senate in 2004.
        In 2008, Obama was elected President of the United States, becoming the first African American to hold the office.
        As President, he is known for his efforts to reform healthcare (Obamacare).
        He was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 2009 for his efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples.
        And since he is the only president on this list that is still alive, he has not yet been commemorated on any currency.
        So, enjoy this sick picture!
