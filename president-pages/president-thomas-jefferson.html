        Coming in at number seven on my list, Thomas Jefferson.
        Thomas Jefferson was an American Founding Father who was born on April 13th, 1743, in Shadwell, Virginia.
        He was the third President of the United States, serving from 1801 to 1809.
        Jefferson was also the author of the Declaration of Independence, which was adopted by the Continental Congress on July 4th, 1776 (Which we now know as Independence Day!).
        He was also instrumental in the formation of the Democratic-Republican Party.
        In addition to his political career, Jefferson was a skilled writer and inventor, credited with inventing the swivel chair and the polygraph machine.
        He died on July 4th, 1826.
        After his death he would be commemorated on the U.S. Nickel and the U.S. 2-dollar bill.
