        Number six, John F. Kennedy.
        John F. Kennedy, commonly known as JFK, was an American politician who served as the 35th President of the United States from January 1961 until his assassination in November 1963.
        He was born on May 29th, 1917, in Brookline, Massachusetts.
        Prior to his presidency, he served as a member of the US House of Representatives and US Senate, representing Massachusetts.
        During his presidency, Kennedy was instrumental in the resolution of the Cuban Missile Crisis.
        JFK also initiated the establishment of the Peace Corps.
        Kennedy's presidency was cut short on November 22nd, 1963, when he was assassinated while riding in a motorcade in Dallas, Texas.
        Similar to Thomas Jefferson, JFK was later commemorated on currency, this time, the U.S. Half-Dollar.
